## Usage üíª
App can be viewed at - [Heroku](https://jate1.herokuapp.com/) üîó

## Task üî®

Create a text/code editor that functions on a single page, follows PWA criteria, and works offline. The application will also able to be downloaded onto your computer or mobile device to be used outside of the browser.

## Tech Stack üß©

- JavaScript
- [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)F
  - Service Workers
  - Create Manifest
- [IndexedDB](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/)

## How to Use üìé

Visit the [deployed application](https://jate1.herokuapp.com/) where you will be presented with a code/text editor. Any code or text you add will save automatically whenever you click off of the window. On refresh or revisit, the text is persistent and saved in IndexedDB.

## User Story üë®‚Äçüíª

```md
AS A developer
I WANT to create notes or code snippets with or without an internet connection
SO THAT I can reliably retrieve them for later use
```

## Acceptance Criteria ‚úÖ

```md
GIVEN a text editor web application
WHEN I open my application in my editor
THEN I should see a client server folder structure
WHEN I run `npm run start` from the root directory
THEN I find that my application should start up the backend and serve the client
WHEN I run the text editor application from my terminal
THEN I find that my JavaScript files have been bundled using webpack
WHEN I run my webpack plugins
THEN I find that I have a generated HTML file, service worker, and a manifest file
WHEN I use next-gen JavaScript in my application
THEN I find that the text editor still functions in the browser without errors
WHEN I open the text editor
THEN I find that IndexedDB has immediately created a database storage
WHEN I enter content and subsequently click off of the DOM window
THEN I find that the content in the text editor has been saved with IndexedDB
WHEN I reopen the text editor after closing it
THEN I find that the content in the text editor has been retrieved from our IndexedDB
WHEN I click on the Install button
THEN I download my web application as an icon on my desktop
WHEN I load my web application
THEN I should have a registered service worker using workbox
WHEN I register a service worker
THEN I should have my static assets pre cached upon loading along with subsequent pages and static assets
WHEN I deploy to Heroku
THEN I should have proper build scripts for a webpack application
```
